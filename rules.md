# Rules

We expect users on chaos.social to adhere to the following rules:

- No content condoning or advocating for the oppression of members of marginalised groups, or general discrimination of
  groups based on characteristics like gender, race, disabilities, nationality, education, religion etc.
- No harassment, stalking, mobbing, deadnaming, misgendering, contacting users who have made it clear they do not wish
  to be contacted.
- Obviously: no content that is illegal in Germany, no actions intended to damage this instance (performance,
  reputation, security).
- No right or alt-right bullshit, Nazi content, conspiracy narratives.
- No automated accounts (unless approved by the moderators). This includes bots, crossposters, feedposters etc.
- When posting to the local timeline, provide Content Warnings for violence, sexually explicit content, death/disease, and politics.
- When posting to the local timeline, provide image descriptions.

*Clarification:* You post to the local timeline when you give your post "public" visibility. If you don't want to follow
local timeline rules, you can post with visibility "unlisted" – posts will still be visible to everybody (your followers
and everybody else), they just won't get shown on the local and federated timelines. Boosts also do not appear on the
local timeline.

## Best practices

We ask users on chaos.social to keep the following guidelines in mind, in order to foster a **considerate and accessible
atmosphere**. Forgetting about them is not as serious as breaking the instance rules, but **repeated malicious
unwillingness** to follow the best practices will be considered just like breaking a rule.

- Use content warnings liberally, especially for topics that are potentially disturbing or controversial, or that make
  life harder for people struggling with addiction or trauma.
- Provide credit for creative works that are not your own.
- Don't be a reply guy – uninvited comments about another user's personal choices, lifestyle or family are strongly discouraged and may be considered harassment.
- In discussions, please remain civil, do not insult the people you're talking to. Don't escalate.

## Enforcement

Rules are only worth as much as their enforcement, so here is what you can expect from the chaos.social moderators (we
will publish our moderation guidelines in the future, but here's the short version):

Breaking these rules can get you kicked off the instance, though unless you're behaving in bad faith, we will give you
several warnings first. Going against the Best Practices can also get you kicked off the instance, but you have to
really persistently act against them (and at that point, why are you on chaos.social?).

Please report behaviour that bothers you. We will keep your report confidential.

## Ultimately,

we ([@leah](https://chaos.social/@leah) and [@rixx](https://chaos.social/@rixx)) are maintaining this instance on our
spare time, hardware and nerves. Don't push either of those.
