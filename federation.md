# Federation

Where there is open communication, there is spam, trolls, harassment and worse. For this reason, there are instances
that we do not federate with, or that we federate with in a limited fashion (e.g. by marking all their media as
sensitive).

The following list of Fediverse instances we block is purely descriptive and informative, to document blocked instances
for users of chaos.social. It is very much **not** intended as a block list, recommendation or template for other instances.

If you think an instance has been unfairly blocked, please contact [@ordnung](https://chaos.social/@ordnung) or via
email at contact@. (Note that if you are on one of these blocked instances, you will have to write an email, as messages
won't go through anymore.)

Instances that don't exist anymore are removed periodically.

## Silenced and blocked users

We do not make moderation decisions on individual users public – you can read more about our reasons in our [moderation
process documentation](/process). The tl;dr is that listing suspended or silenced users invites terrible behaviour on
all sides. By blocking a user, we intend to stop them from harming our users or our instance, we do *not* need to incite
others to harass them, or them to start a crusade against us.

## Silenced instances

Silenced instances don't appear in the Federated timeline, but their accounts can still be seen, e.g. by searching for
them, by interacting with them in conversations, or by following them.

## Defederated instances

Instance blocks have developed something of a jargon over the course of the years. Most things should be understandable.
The least intuitive one is probably the "free speech zone". Instances announcing themselves like that usually mean that
they are unwilling to moderate content at all, including things like Nazi propaganda, harassment or sometimes even
pedophilia in the name of free speech.

¹ "Free speech zone": Frequent excuse for complete lack of moderation in the face of rampant aggressive behaviour and discrimination.
