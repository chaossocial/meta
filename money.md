# Money

chaos.social runs entirely on donations to [chaos.social e.V.i.Gr.](/governance). We'll begin publishing regular
financial reports in 2023.

## How to donate

There are three ways of sending us money. In order of preference:

1. **Bank transfers** are hands-down the best way to send us money. Even better: do it as a standing order – having a
   somewhat regular income is what lets us sleep at night.<br>**Account holder:** chaos.social e.V.<br>**IBAN:**
   DE64830654080005279186
2. [PayPal](//paypal.me/chaossocial) also works. PayPal does take a cut, but that's fine, and it's more accessible from
   outside the EU.

3. If you absolutely have to, you can also use [liberapay](//liberapay.com/chaos.social) – but we'd prefer the other
   ways.<br><small>Liberapay makes it seem like we have a regular, weekly income, but we receive the money as a lump sum
   at the beginning – so we don't know which interval it was intended for, receiving several confusing payments per
   week. The payout is handled by Stripe, which also takes a generous cut. Still better than nothing, but … not
   great.</small>

## Reports

Coming soon, once our accounting is up and running.
